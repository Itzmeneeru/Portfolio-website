  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Neeraj Bisht</strong>, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from <strong>DIT University</strong>. 
    Ever since my school days, I have been deeply fascinated by technology, problem-solving, and the growing impact of data in shaping decisions. 
    This passion gradually led me towards the exciting and impactful field of <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, where I see myself building a strong career in the years ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    At present, I am strengthening my technical foundation with a diverse set of programming and analytical skills. I am actively learning 
    <strong>Python</strong>, which is widely regarded as the backbone of data analytics and machine learning. In addition to Python, I have hands-on 
    experience with <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and basic knowledge of the <strong>C programming language</strong>. 
    These languages not only help me understand the principles of programming but also give me the ability to create logical solutions, design 
    responsive websites, and write efficient code. As part of my learning, I have also started exploring data analysis libraries like Pandas and 
    visualization tools like Matplotlib, which help me interpret and present data effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career aspiration is to become a skilled <strong>Data Analyst</strong>, working in a reputed organization where I can apply my knowledge to solve 
    real-world problems. I believe data is more than just numbers ‚Äî it tells stories, reveals hidden opportunities, and drives impactful decisions. 
    By mastering analytical techniques, I aim to help companies grow, make informed strategies, and innovate based on meaningful insights. 
    My long-term vision is to combine my technical expertise with strong business understanding, so I can contribute not only as a programmer but 
    also as a decision-maker who adds value to any organization I work with.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond academics, I strongly believe in continuous self-improvement and learning from every experience. I am committed to improving my problem-solving 
    ability, logical reasoning, and communication skills, all of which are crucial for a successful career in data analytics. I also enjoy working on 
    collaborative projects, where teamwork and knowledge-sharing help bring out the best in everyone. I am building my portfolio with projects such as a 
    hotel booking website, portfolio website, and small-scale data analysis tasks, which reflect both my creativity and my growing technical knowledge.
  </p>

   <p>
    I consider myself a person of balance ‚Äî someone who values both technical skills and personal growth. I am a 
    <strong>spiritual person</strong> and strongly believe in <strong>God‚Äôs plan</strong>. This faith gives me strength, patience, 
    and positivity as I continue my journey. I believe that with dedication, humility, and trust in God, everything happens at the 
    right time and in the best way possible.
  </p>
